Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What percentage of the lecture videos have you watched so far?

50%

## What time, location and duration have you scheduled to watch lecture videos?

I usually watch the lecture videos at 8 PM in my room for about 1-2 hours each day. This helps me stay consistent and focused.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

I’ve been keeping up with the lecture material and practicing coding regularly. I will continue to review the videos right after the lectures to reinforce the concepts.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I need to stop procrastinating on assignments and work on them earlier. I tend to leave them for the last minute, which makes it harder to do quality work.

## What are you currently doing poorly for practicals in this subject that you will change?

I have been struggling with debugging my code effectively in practicals. I will spend more time understanding error messages and using tools like print statements to track down issues.

## What are you doing really well for practicals in this subject?

I’ve been good at breaking down problems into smaller, manageable tasks. This helps me stay organized and focused during practicals.
