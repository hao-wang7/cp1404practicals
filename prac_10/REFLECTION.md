CP1404 Practical Reflection
Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.
Replace each ... with your meaningful answer.

Estimates
Regarding the estimates that you did for practical tasks...

How was your estimate accuracy usually?
My estimate accuracy was generally moderate, with simple tasks closely matching actual time, but I often underestimated complex tasks due to unanticipated challenges.

How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?
As the course progressed, I improved by breaking tasks into smaller parts and factoring in time for debugging, resulting in more precise estimates.

What did you learn from doing these estimates?
I learned to allocate buffer time for unexpected issues, the value of reviewing past estimates to enhance accuracy, and how to better gauge task complexity.

Code Reviews
What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?
Being reviewed showed me the importance of writing concise, readable code and taught me to embrace feedback to refine my coding practices.

What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?
Reviewing othersâ€™ code helped me spot potential issues, appreciate diverse coding approaches, and improve my ability to give clear, constructive feedback.

Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past pracs.
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

Good Code Review 1
https://github.com/askhatov21/cp1404-askhatov-amir/pull/5
Explanation
In this review, I highlighted unclear function names, suggesting more intuitive ones, and identified a boundary condition error, proposing a fix that improved code robustness.

Good Code Review 2
https://github.com/EkaTiuJCU/cp1404practicals/pull/2
Explanation
I provided feedback on code duplication, recommending shared logic extraction, and noted style guide violations. These suggestions were adopted, enhancing code clarity and maintainability.

Practicals
Regarding the practical tasks overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?
I would add more staged feedback points to guide students early and introduce optional projects to encourage exploration of advanced programming challenges.

What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?
I excelled at writing clear, well-documented code and actively engaged in code reviews, using feedback to consistently improve my code quality and design approach.
