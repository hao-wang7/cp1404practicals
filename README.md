## Lessons Learned About Clean Code
- **Avoid Code Duplication**: Follow the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle by extracting common functionality into functions or classes, reducing redundancy and improving maintainability.
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Ensure each function or class has a single, well-defined purpose, making code modular, easier to test, and simpler to modify.
- **Effective Comments and Documentation**: Write concise, clear comments and documentation to explain code intent, helping others understand the logic quickly.
